# HTML5 YAML Compass (SASS) Kickstarter

**v1.0**

This is my construction set for starting a new web project. Basically it contains elements from the **[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)**, the CSS Framework **[YAML](http://www.yaml.de)**, the CSS preprocessor **[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)** in combination with the SASS Framework **[Compass](http://compass-style.org/)** and the **[Build Script](https://github.com/h5bp/ant-build-script)** to compress the result.

Also the JavaScript is written in **[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)** but all CoffeeScript files are compiled to readable JavaScript (no compression). So you don't need to know CoffeeScript and can work in the compiled JavaScript files.
